![ER Diagram](myapp_models.png)

## Description

The E-Commerce Application is a Django and React-based web application designed for managing an online store. This application enables customers to browse products, add items to their carts, and place orders, while providing features for sellers to manage product listings and inventory. Admins have full control over the data, including the ability to manage users, products, and orders.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework for developing the application backend, managing user authentication, and handling database operations.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the frontend of the application.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight relational database used for storing and managing data, integrated with Djangoâ€™s ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration tools for managing the project's source code and tracking changes.

## Database Overview

The `ecommerce_db` database includes several tables, managed by Django models:

- **Customers**: Manages customer data and includes information like name, contact details, and order history.
- **Products**: Stores product details, including product name, price, availability, and categories.
